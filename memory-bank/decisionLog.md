## .gitignore Configuration (2025-03-07)

**Description:**  
Updated .gitignore file to include project-specific paths and configurations.

**Rationale:**
- Prevent tracking of build artifacts, dependencies, and environment-specific files
- Maintain clean repository history
- Avoid accidental commits of sensitive information
- Standardize ignored files across development environments

**Implementation Details:**
1. Added TypeScript/Next.js specific ignores (.next/, .tsbuildinfo)
2. Added dependency directories (node_modules/)
3. Added build and output directories (dist/, build/, out/, coverage/)
4. Added IDE and environment files (.vscode/, .idea/, .env*)
5. Added common OS and temp files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db, *.tmp)
6. Added memory-bank directory to prevent versioning of project management files

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Using a minimal .gitignore with only basic exclusions
- Creating separate .gitignore files for different environments
- Using .git/info/exclude for local exclusions

**Impact:**
- Improved repository cleanliness
- Standardized development environment
- Reduced risk of sensitive data exposure
- Better collaboration through consistent file tracking
