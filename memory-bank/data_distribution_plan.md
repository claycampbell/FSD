# Instruments Reference Data Distribution Plan

## Use Cases:
### Full Files:
- Generate complete reference data files covering all instruments.
- Include comprehensive metadata to ensure compatibility with downstream systems.

### Cancellation Full Files:
- Provide cancellation files for retracted instrument records.
- Ensure proper tagging to avoid conflicts with active records.

### Delta Files:
- Produce delta files that highlight updated or new instrument records.
- Delta files must be distributed in real-time for immediate access.

### Invalid Records:
- Generate files containing invalid or rejected instrument records, detailing reasons for rejection.

## File Naming Conventions:
- Standardize file names based on content type and timestamp:
  - `YYYYMMDD_full.csv` for full files.
  - `YYYYMMDD_cancellation.csv` for cancellation files.
  - `YYYYMMDD_delta.csv` for delta files.
  - `YYYYMMDD_invalid.csv` for invalid records.

## Distribution Procedures:
- Establish secure file transfer protocols for distributing files.
  - Use HUBEX/HUBDE systems for file delivery.
- Provide administrative controls for monitoring file delivery success and errors.
