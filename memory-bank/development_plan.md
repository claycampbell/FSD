*   Implement the transmission and format validation rules as defined in Annex 1a and Annex 1b.
*   Implement the logic for providing feedback to submitting entities (3.2.6).
*   Implement the use case for downloading files (3.2.7).

## 3. Instruments Reference Data Processing:

*   Implement the on-the-fly processing phase (3.3.2.1) and the end-of-day/post-processing phase (3.3.2.2).

*   Implement the logic for performing reference data content validation (3.3.3) based on Table 33.
*   Implement the use cases for updating the Received Reference Data Table (3.3.4) and the RCA data table (3.3.5).
*   Implement the RCA determination logic (3.3.6), including all the sub-use cases for different determination rules.
*   Implement the consistency validation checks (3.3.7) and the logic for providing file feedback (3.3.8).
*   Implement the end-of-day processing tasks, including applying RCA reassessment results (3.3.9) and updating the consistent reference data table (3.3.10).
*   Implement the logic for generating information about rejections (3.3.11).

## 4. Tools for ESMA Business Administrators:

*   Implement the use cases for submitting requests to set termination dates (3.4.1) and change RCA\_MIC (3.4.2).

## 5. RCA Change Management:

*   Implement the user interface for reviewing and acting on RCA change requests (3.5.2).
*   Implement the yearly RCA reassessment process for equities (3.5.3).
*   Implement the use cases for changing RCA\_MIC (3.5.4), submitting requests to change RCA (3.5.5), and reviewing and acting on RCA change requests (3.5.6) and yearly reassessment results (3.5.7).

## 6. Instruments Reference Data Distribution:

*   Implement the use cases for creating and distributing full files (3.6.2), cancellation full files (3.6.3), delta files (3.6.4), and invalid records files (3.6.5).

## 7. Instruments Reference Data Publication:

*   Implement the use cases for creating public full files (3.7.2), cancellation full files (3.7.3), and delta files (3.7.4).
*   Implement the logic for publishing instrument reference data (3.7.5) and providing search and export functionality (3.7.6).
*   Implement the use case for downloading full/delta public files (3.7.7).

## 8. Additional Reference Data Management:

*   Implement the use cases for updating LEI reference data (3.8.1.2), countries reference data (3.8.1.3), MIC reference data (3.8.1.5), and the list of valid CFI codes (3.8.1.6).
*   Implement the use cases for non-working day data management (3.8.2), including data collection (3.8.2.2), updating the reporting calendar (3.8.2.3), and updating the reporting calendar for TV/SI on a yearly basis (3.8.2.4).
*   Implement the use cases for expression of interest on indices management (3.9), including collecting expressions of interest (3.9.2).
*   Implement the use cases for additional reference data distribution (3.10), including distributing LEI full files (3.10.2), country full files (3.10.3), currency full files (3.10.4), MIC full files (3.10.5), CFI full files (3.10.6), expression of interest on indices files (3.10.7), non-working days files (3.10.8), and previous versions of LEI and MIC full files (3.10.9, 3.10.10).

## 9. Monitoring:

*   Implement the use cases for monitoring (3.11), including missing/incomplete report notifications (3.11.2) and monthly report generation for NCAs delegating data collection (3.11.3).

## 10. System Administration:

*   Implement the use cases for system administration (3.12), including user management (3.12.2), system monitoring (3.12.3), and system configuration (3.12.4).

## 11. Interfaces:

*   Implement all the interfaces described in Section 4, including those with the Transparency System (4.1), FIRDS Reference Data view (4.2), FIRDS Reporting Calendar view (4.3), DIFEA (4.4), and ESMA Registers (4.5).

## 12. XML Messages:

*   Ensure that all XML messages comply with the schemas defined in Section 5 and Annexes.

## 13. Data Structures:

*   Implement all the data structures described in Section 6, including the reporting files table (6.1), NCA reference data table (6.2), CFI/RCA rule mapping table (6.3), CFI-based validations table (6.4), expression of interest on indices reference data table (6.5), trading venue mapping view (6.6), reporting flow view (6.7), instrument yearly turnover view (6.8), RTS23 fields table (6.9), additional field table (6.10), rejection statistics table (6.11), rejected records table (6.12), yearly RCA reassessment input data table (6.13), RCA\_MIC adjustments data table (6.14), RCA\_MIC adjustments error data table (6.15), set TERMINATION\_DATE error data table (6.16), set TERMINATION\_DATE data table (6.17), and MIC\_UPREG\_STAGING data table (6.18).
