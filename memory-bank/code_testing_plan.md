# Code Implementation and Testing Plan

## Coding Standards:
### Best Practices:
- Adhere to widely accepted coding standards, ensuring maintainability and readability.
- Implement modular and reusable code structures for scalability.

### Formatting and Style:
- Use consistent formatting across files:
  - Apply linting tools to maintain syntax consistency.
  - Follow naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.

## Testing Strategies:
### Unit Testing:
- Write tests for individual modules and functions:
  - Ensure edge cases are accounted for.
  - Mock dependencies for isolated test environments.

### Integration Testing:
- Test interactions between FIRDS modules:
  - Validate file flows from submission to publication.
  - Ensure seamless integration across interfaces and external systems.

### Performance Testing:
- Evaluate system response times during high-volume submissions.
- Test scalability to handle concurrent data flows.

## Documentation Requirements:
### Code Documentation:
- Use inline comments to explain logic behind complex code fragments.
- Generate automated documentation using tools (e.g., JSDoc).

### Test Documentation:
- Document test cases with detailed descriptions:
  - Specify inputs, expected outcomes, and actual results.
  
### System Documentation:
- Maintain high-level documentation for module design and dependencies:
  - Include diagrams for data workflows and system architecture.

## Debugging and Error Handling:
- Implement robust error handling routines across all modules:
  - Avoid system crashes for invalid inputs.
  - Log errors in dedicated tables for quick debugging.

## Release Management:
- Monitor test coverage to maintain high standards during releases.
- Conduct code reviews prior to deploying production builds.
