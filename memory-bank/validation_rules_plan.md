# Validation Rules Plan

## Overview:
- This plan outlines the implementation of validation rules for ensuring the integrity and compliance of submitted data.

## Types of Validation:
### Field-Level Validations:
- Ensure mandatory fields are present in all submissions.
- Validate field formats:
  - Dates adhere to ISO 8601.
  - Numeric values fall within pre-defined ranges.

### Format Checks:
- Verify file formats based on Annex 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d specifications.
- Ensure XML messages comply with schema definitions.

### Consistency Validations:
- Identify and resolve discrepancies in reference data integrity:
  - Duplicate records.
  - Conflicting field values across dependent tables.

## Rule Application:
### Transmission Rules:
- Validate checksum integrity and metadata correctness at the point of transmission.

### File Content Rules:
- Ensure submitted files adhere to structural requirements.
- Generate error reports for infractions with actionable feedback.

### RCA Validation:
- Apply RCA determination logic to submitted data records.
- Enforce compliance with MIC code mappings.

## Testing and Debugging:
- Develop test suites to validate each rule with edge cases.
- Implement debugging tools for administrators to monitor rule execution.

## Automation:
- Automate periodic audits for validation compliance across all reference data tables.

## Performance Considerations:
- Optimize validation processes for high-volume data submissions:
  - Parallel processing for real-time validations.
  - Caching mechanisms for frequently checked rules.
