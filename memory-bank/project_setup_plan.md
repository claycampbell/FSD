# Project Setup and Initialization Plan

## 1. Project Structure:
- Create the following directories:
  - `src`: Contains source code for FIRDS modules.
  - `docs`: Includes documentation for the project.
  - `tests`: Contains unit and integration tests.
  - `memory-bank`: Contains the project's memory bank files, including core context files.

## 2. Git Repository:
- Initialize a Git repository:
  - Run `git init`.
- Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files. Example entries:
```
# Compiled source #
###################
*.com
*.class
*.dll
*.exe
*.o
*.so

# Packages #
############
*.jar
*.war
*.ear

# virtual machine metadata #
############################
.next/

- `memory-bank`: Contains the project's memory bank files, including context, progress, and decision logs.

## Development Plan
See `memory-bank/development_plan.md` for a detailed breakdown of the development tasks.
```

## 4. Memory Bank Initialization:
- Ensure the following core files exist in `memory-bank`:
  - `activeContext.md`: Tracks the current session context.
  - `productContext.md`: Provides an overview of the project.
