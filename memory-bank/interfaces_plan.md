# Interfaces Plan

## Overview:
- This plan outlines the integration interfaces necessary for FIRDS functionality.

## Transparency System Integration:
### Use Cases:
- Implement API endpoints for interacting with the Transparency System.
- Ensure seamless data synchronization between FIRDS and Transparency System.

## FIRDS Views:
### Use Cases:
- Develop interfaces for:
  - Reference Data view.
  - Reporting Calendar view.
- Ensure views provide field-level validations and user-centric filtering options.

## DIFEA Integration:
### Use Cases:
- Implement connection protocols to exchange data with DIFEA systems.
- Ensure DIFEA interfaces adhere to ESMA standards for accuracy and security.

## ESMA Registers:
### Use Cases:
- Design and integrate interfaces to interact with ESMA Registers.
- Support search functionalities for querying register data across FIRDS modules.

## Design and Scaling:
- Ensure interfaces are scalable to handle large amounts of concurrent data transfers.
- Optimize endpoints to minimize latency and maximize throughput efficiency.

## Security Measures:
- Implement authentication and validation layers for all external connections.
- Ensure data integrity and encryption during communications.
