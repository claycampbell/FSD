# Data Collection and Validation Module Plan

## Use Cases:
### Uploading Data:
- Implement functionality for users to upload various report files, ensuring compatibility with supported formats.

### Routing Files:
- Develop algorithms for intelligently routing incoming files to their designated processing pipelines based on metadata and file type.

### Transmission Validation:
- Implement transmission validation rules as defined in Annex 1a.
- Ensure the integrity of transmitted files by comparing their generated checksums with expected values.

### File Format Validation:
- Implement format validation checks as per Annex 1b, ensuring compliance with XML schemas and other structural requirements.

### Downloading Files:
- Provide functionality for authorized users to securely download processed reports and validation output files.

## Components for HUBEX and HUBDE Interaction:
- Design components for seamless interaction with HUBEX/HUBDE systems:
  - File transfer mechanisms for uploading and retrieving files from HUBEX/HUBDE.
  - API integration for validating transmission acknowledgment and error messages.

## Validation Rules:
- Implement critical validation rules for transmission and file formatting:
  - Define logic for identifying invalid/malformed input files.
  - Ensure metadata and format compliance.

## Feedback Mechanisms:
- Develop logic for providing feedback to submitting entities:
  - Generate error reports for rejected files, detailing transmission and format issues.
  - Provide reports highlighting missing or incomplete data.
