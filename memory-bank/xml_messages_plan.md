# XML Messages Plan

## Compliance Requirements:
### Schema Validation:
- Implement XML validation mechanisms to enforce compliance with schemas outlined in Section 5 and Annexes.
- Ensure proper namespace definitions for all XML documents.

## Validation Logic:
- Automate field-level validation for transmitted XML data:
  - Verify mandatory fields are present.
  - Ensure field values adhere to expected formats, including date/time and numeric ranges.

## Transmission Workflow:
- Design workflows to validate XML messages during:
  - Transmission (real-time checks).
  - Processing (batch XML validation).

## Error Reporting:
- Generate detailed error reports for all rejected XML messages:
  - Highlight the specific validation rule that triggered the rejection.
  - Provide actionable feedback for submitting entities.

## Security Measures:
- Encrypt transmitted XML messages for secure communications between systems.
- Verify message integrity using checksums.

## Testing Strategy:
- Develop test suites for XML validation:
  - Test against edge cases, including malformed XML structures.
  - Ensure high accuracy with schema compliance tests.
